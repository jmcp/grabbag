About this repo
---------------

This repo is a collection of code that I've written for various purposes
over the years. All code in this repo is available for you to use under the
terms of the MIT license. Please review [LICENSE][LICENSE] for details.


None of the code in this repo is guaranteed to work *for you*. If it does
then that's a beautiful side effect. This is what I have written to solve
various interesting-at-the-time problems, and if it gives you an example
of how you could solve a problem you have come across, then I'm happy.
